REBOOTING VIM
=============

After borrowing vim configurations from others for years, I have
finally rebooted and have built my own vim configuration from
scratch.  No cargo-culting: if I don't know what it is, it isn't
in my .vimrc file.

Install
-------

  cd ~
  git clone git://github.com:joelhelbling/vim-from-scratch.git .vim
  ln -s ./vim/vimrc .vimrc
